        bio: "Er. K. D. Chaudhri as the first Chairman-cum-Managing Director (CMD) of the Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd. (PSPCL). He is recognised as the chief architect of strengthening the power sector in Punjab during his tenure spanning about 42 years. Under his stewardship, Punjab transitioned towards being a power-surplus state. He spearheaded a large-scale initiative to strengthen the state's transmission and distribution (T&D) network, committing over ₹1,611 crore under the Restructured Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme (R-APDRP).Chaudhri's tenure was marked by a strategic pivot toward technology to enhance customer services. Key initiatives included the launch of a single-number call center, 1912, for complaints, with a third-party feedback system to ensure genuine resolution. The corporation also implemented the SAP system for billing transparency and used GIS mapping to identify high-loss areas. Online bill payment facilities and a single-window system for new connections were also introduced.The success of these reforms was acknowledged with several national awards and high ratings. PSPCL was named the Best Performing Power Utility in the country by the Central Board of Irrigation and Power in 2015. It also received an A+ rating from the Ministry of Power, placing it in the top tier of power utilities alongside those of Gujarat. Additionally, PSPCL was awarded as the Best Digital PSU by the Department of Governance Reforms, Punjab, for its e-Governance initiatives. Er. K. D. Chaudhri’s leadership is best understood as a case study of a technocrat who successfully drove modernization and operational excellence while navigating deeply entrenched structural, financial, and political challenges inherent to a public sector enterprise.",
